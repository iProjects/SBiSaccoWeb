                    Soft Books Sacco is a system developed to meet the entire needs of a Sacco organisation in a growing environment.
The system comprises of various operational and management modules that will greatly assist in the day-to-day management of a Sacco. The modules are integrated into an overall system and they function inter-dependently to provide a collective Sacco resource planning and management tool.<br>

All transactional reports and financial statements can easily be produced without any additional manual work and can even be printed immediately after a transaction.<br>
                    The system offers a flexible chart of accounts where users can define their own general ledger codes and accounts.<br>
